Your friend has discovered an old machine that performs simple mathematical operations. The machine has only two buttons:

+1 — adds one to the current number.

x2 — multiplies the current number by two.

The machine starts with the number 1. Now, your friend wants to know how many different ways it is possible to obtain a given number n using these buttons. Help them write a program that calculates this number.

Constraint: 1 ≤ n ≤ 10**6
