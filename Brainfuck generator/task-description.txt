Convert text to BF ( https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck )
You are tasked with writing a function that converts a given string to BF that would print the given string.

For example, if we were to call the function with the string "Hello World!" it might give us a result that is something like: "-[------->+<]>-.-[->+++++<]>++.+++++++..+++.[--->+<]>-----.---[->+++<]>.-[--->+<]>---.+++.------.--------.-[--->+<]>.".

If we execute that code, we would get "Hello World!" as the output.
