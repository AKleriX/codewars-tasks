All Unix user know the command line history. This one comes with a set of useful commands know as the bang command.

For this second kata we will explore the !n command, according to the man page this one refer to command line n.

In this kata you should complete a function that take in an integer that correspond to n, and an history with the following format:

  1  cd /pub
  2  more beer
  3  lost
  4  ls 
  5  touch me 
  6  chmod 000 me 
  7  more me
  8  history

and that should return the nth executed command line, for example with n=4 and the above history it should return ls. If user ask for a n without any know entry for example n=12 here, the function should return !12: event not found. Note: For this kata we will assume that n >= 1.
