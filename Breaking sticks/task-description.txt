Task:
You get two sticks of lengths > 0
You can break them into pieces of integer lengths
Your task is to construct the biggest square from those sticks, which means that you need 4 pieces of the same length
The longer the side of the square, the bigger the square

Output:
if square can be constructed --> length of the side of that square
if square can't be constructed --> 0

Examples:
square(0.25, 3.75) -> 0
3 pieces of length 1 -> no square

square(2, 2) -> 1
4 pieces of length 1 -> square, side_length = 1

square(5, 14) -> 4
4 pieces of length 4 -> square, side_length = 4
