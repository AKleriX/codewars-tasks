Did you ever see the movie called Snakes on a Plane?

It starred Samuel L. Jackson as the hero and had a complicated plot with (SPOILER) snakes that were (SPOILER) on a plane.

In this Kata there are also snakes on a plane but now YOU can be the hero.

Task
Count how many snakes are on the plane

If you are correct  everybody lives!

If you fail,  we all die!

No pressure!

Start counting NOW...

1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. hang on didn't you count that one twice? 1.. 2.. dammit stop wriggling

Notes:

snakes are "coloured" by a single character per snake, and no two snakes have the same colour.
snakes can be any length
snake bodies go up/down/left/right (not diagonally)
see the example tests for what snakes in planes look like
