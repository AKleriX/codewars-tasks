Given a string, output the encoded version of that string.

Example:
Input:
'When nobody is around, the trees gossip about the people who have walked under them.'
First, the input is normalized; Any character other than alphabetic characters should be removed from the text and the message is converted into lowercase. Only English alphabets (upper and lower case) and valid non-alphabetic characters will be passed i.e.,:

!"#$%&'()*+, -./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
No digits will be passed as input

The input is normalized into:
'whennobodyisaroundthetreesgossipaboutthepeoplewhohavewalkedunderthem'
The text is then organized into a rectangle of size (a * b) such that b >= a and b - a <= 1. The last row, if incomplete, should be padded with spaces. Since the length of the normalized text is 68, we use an 8*9 rectangle giving;

'whennobod'
'yisaround'
'thetreesg'
'ossipabou'
'tthepeopl'
'ewhohavew'
'alkedunde'
'rthem    '
The final message is obtained by reading the rectangle down each column from left to right, and separated into b chunks of length a, separated by spaces. No characters other than lowercase English alphabets and spaces are to be used in the output.

Output:
'wytotear hihstwlt eseshhkh natieoee nrrpphdm ooeaeau  buebovn  onsoped  ddgulwe '
