The drawing shows 6 squares the sides of which have a length of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. The perimeter of the overall rectangle is 42.

Could you give the perimeter of a rectangle when there are n + 1 squares disposed in the same manner as in the drawing:

The function perimeter has the parameter n where n + 1 is the number of squares (they are numbered from 0 to n), and returns the perimeter of the overall rectangle (not of its component squares).

JS: The result of the random tests can go up to 210 digits. So, return the result in the form of BigInt.
