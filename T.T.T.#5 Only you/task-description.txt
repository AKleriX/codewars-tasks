Rules
Please determine if the string s is "only you":

The string should contains "you". Such as "only you","I love you","Nice to meet you";
"you" can be discontinuous. Such as "y o u","y@o#u","yaobu";
"you" should ignore case. Such as "You","YOU","YoU".
The string should NOT contains "I","me","he","him","they","them","we". They MUST be continuous, but ignore the case.

  If the string s conforms to the above condition, returns true; otherwise, returns false.
