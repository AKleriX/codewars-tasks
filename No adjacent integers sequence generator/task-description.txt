Write a function that returns a list of all the integers from lower ( inclusive ) to upper ( exclusive ) in a such way that no two adjacent numbers in the list are numerically adjacent ( e.g. 5 cannot be next to 4 or 6 ).

The maximum sequence length tested is 107. The minimum sequence length tested is long enough.

Examples
For solution(0,6): 5,0,4,1,3,2 would not be acceptable, because 3 and 2 are adjacent. 0,2,5,3,1,4 would be acceptable.
