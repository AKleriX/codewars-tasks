You are given an array of documents (strings), a term (string), and two booleans finetuning your indexing operation. Return an array containing the document IDs (1-based indices of documents in the array), where the term occurs, sorted in ascending order.

Booleans:

CaseSensitive: test matches test, but not Test
Not CaseSensitive: test matches both test and Test

Exact Match: test matches test and .test!, but not attest or test42
Not Exact Match: test matches both test and attest

Example:
buildInvertedIndex(["Sign", "sign", "Signature", "Sign-ature"], "Sign", true, true)

return [1,4]
