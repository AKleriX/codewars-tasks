Task
Write a function that gets a square of a number without the following:

Your code mustn't contain any *s and you cannot use the pow function. Edit: You also cannot use __mul__ / imul function
You cannot import any external libraries (unless you are satisfied with random being pre-imported).
Only one function can be defined.
Loophole solutions will not be accepted (see below).
If I use test.expect in my restriction tests, that is okay. This is not an issue.
Input will always be positive or 0
The code has a length limit:
Your code must be under or equal to 25 characters (and you already have to use 6 for the function name).

Example of a loophole solution:

square=lambda n:eval(')2,n(wop'[::-1])
