escription:
The goal of this kata is to multiply two integers using the ancient Egyptian method ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_multiplication ), which only requires divisions and multiplications by two, and additions.

Your function takes two integers as input. It shall return a list of the steps in the multiplication.

Let m be the largest and n the smallest. While m is superior to 0, at each step:

if m is not divisible by 2, add n to the list
divide m by 2 (integer division)
multiply n by 2

At the end, return the list in descending order. The result of the multiplication is the sum of the list elements, but you have to return only the list.

Input
n and m integers, from 0 to 10,000. It is not guaranteed that m > n.

Example
m	  n	  m % 2	list
100	15	0	    []
50	30	0	    []
25	60	1	    [60]
12	120	0	    [60]
6	  240	0	    [60]
3	  480	1	    [480, 60]
1	  960	1	    [960, 480, 60]
0		0	        [960, 480, 60]

100 * 15 = 1500 = 60 + 480 + 960

So the expected result is [960, 480, 60].
