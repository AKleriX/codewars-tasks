Task
Given any positive integer x ≤ 4000, find the smallest positive integer m such that mx consists of all 9's. Return -1 if no such m exists.

Examples:
allNines(11) -> 9, because 11*9 = 99.

allNines(12) -> -1, because 12 is even, so no multiple of it can be all 9's.

allNines(13) -> 76923, because 13*76923 = 999999, and no smaller positive integer, when multiplied by 13, generates an integer containing only 9's.

NOTE: Although x ≤ 4000, m can be very very LARGE. (x is limited to 4000 because at x = 4327, the value of m exceeds Python's limit (4300 digits) for integer -> string conversion.)
