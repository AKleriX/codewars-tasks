Run Length Encoding is used to compress data. RLE works like this: characters = "AAAALOTOOOOFTEEEEXXXXXXT" then the encoding will store AAAA = A4 and L1 So all together:

encode("AAAALOTOOOOFTEEEEXXXXXXT") == "A4L1O1T1O4F1T1E4X6T1"
# or
encode("HELLO WORLD") == "H1E1L2O1 1W1O1R1L1D1"
# or
encode("FOO+BAR") == "F1O2+1B1A1R1"

as you can see, its not always as efficient, but with some specific data it works!
