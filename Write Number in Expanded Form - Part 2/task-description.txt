Write Number in Expanded Form - Part 2
This is version 2 of my 'Write Number in Exanded Form' Kata.

You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in expanded form.

For example:

expandedForm(1.24); // should return '1 + 2/10 + 4/100'
expandedForm(7.304); // should return '7 + 3/10 + 4/1000'
expandedForm(0.04); // should return '4/100'
expandedForm(807.304); // Should return '800 + 7 + 3/10 + 4/1000'
