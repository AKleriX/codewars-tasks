So we've had nifty-well-working javascript function

returnSomeData()

that was returning useful data, but recently it stopped work.

There is some strange error. Can you find it out, what has changed?

Tip: if in doubt, take a look at Mozilla's Lexical Grammar ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar ) (thanks jpot for link!). Answer is somewhere here.
