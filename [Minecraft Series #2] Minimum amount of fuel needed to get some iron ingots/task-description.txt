Just another day in the world of Minecraft, Steve is getting ready to start his next exciting project -- building a railway system!

But first, Steve needs to melt some iron ores in the furnace to get the main building blocks of rails -- iron ingots.Alt text

Each iron ingot takes 11 seconds* to produce. Steve needs a lot of them, and he has the following fuel options to add into the furnace:

Buckets of lava, each lasts 800 seconds*

Blaze rod, each lasts 120 seconds

Coals, each lasts 80 seconds

Blocks of Wood, each lasts 15 seconds

Sticks, each lasts 1 second*

In Ruby: Write a function calc_fuel that calculates the minimum amount of fuel needed to produce a certain number of iron ingots. This function should return a hash of the form {:lava => 2, :blaze_rod => 1, :coal => 1, :wood => 0, :stick => 0} 

In JavaScript: Write a function calcFuel that calculates the minimum amount of fuel needed to produce a certain number of iron ingots. This function should return an object of the form {lava: 2, blazeRod: 1, coal: 1, wood: 0, stick: 0} 

In Python: Write a function calc_fuel that calculates the minimum amount of fuel needed to produce a certain number of iron ingots. This function should return a dictionary of the form {"lava": 2, "blaze rod": 1, "coal": 1, "wood": 0, "stick": 0}
