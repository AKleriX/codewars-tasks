Background
Every time you photocopy something the quality of the copy is never quite as good as the original.

But then you make a copy of copy, and then a copy of that copy, et cetera... And the results get worse each time.

This kind of degradation is called Generation Loss.

Here is a fun example of generation loss copying VHS tapes.

Kata task
In this Kata you will be given 2 sheets of paper.

The first one is the original, and the second one is the result of copying many times. Let's call these papers orig and copy.

Only a small % of generation loss happens at each copy, but the effect is cummulative and the copies quickly become more like gibberish.

Your task is to return true/false if orig is a possible ancestor of copy.

Notes
The orig document may include any kind of character
Copied characters will degrade as follows: A-Z ⇒ a-z ⇒ # ⇒ + ⇒ : ⇒ . ⇒  
Any other character not mentioned above (e.g. digits) do not degrade
For the uppercase to lowercase degradation the letters must be the same (i.e. A ⇒ a ... Z ⇒ z)
