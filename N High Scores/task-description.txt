Description
You've been given the task of retrieving the top N high scores from players of a video game.

You need to write the function top_scores(records, n_top)

where records is a list of lists in the form of

records = [
  ["Bob", 100],
  ["Jane", 120],
  ["Alice", 10],
  ["Bob", 110],
  ["Bob", 10]
]

and n_top is an integer.

The function should return the top n records, where each user name can appear at most a single time. Records should be in from highest to lowest. Users with the same score should be in alphabetical order.

>>> top_scores(records, 3)
[["Jane", 120],["Bob", 110],["Alice", 10]]

if n_top is negative or 0, the returned value should be an empty list.

if n_top is greater than the total number of records, you should include as many valid records as possible.
