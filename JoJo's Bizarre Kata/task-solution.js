/*you can either create a valid regex to find if a character
is a JoJo or create a function for it.
bonus points if you do both ;)*/

/*Oh, and think about beginners: try to be informative and
comment with some explanation for the sake of their learning!*/

const regex = /(^jo.* jo.*$)|(^jo.* .*jo$)|(^gio.* gio.*$)/i; //your regex here or...

function isJojo(name) {
  //...your code here - do not delete either one even if not used
}
