Imagine a circle. To encode the word codewars, we could split the circle into 8 parts (as codewars has 8 letters):

If we read the result from left to right, we get csordaew.

Decoding is the same process in reverse. If we decode csordaew, we get codewars.

Examples:

encode "codewars" -> "csordaew"
decode "csordaew" -> "codewars"

encode "white" -> "wehti"
decode "wehti" -> "white"
