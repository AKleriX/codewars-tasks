Define a variable ALPHABET that contains the (english) alphabet in lowercase.


Too simple? Well, you can only use the following characters set:

 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz().
 
(space included)


You code must starts with ALPHABET =  then respects the charset limitation.

Ofc you wouldn't cheat by importing the string module or using eval/exec...
