You are provided with a skeleton of the class Fraction, which accepts two arguments (numerator, denominator).

Your task is to make this class string representable, and addable while keeping the result in the minimum representation possible.

Note: your class should not subclass fractions.Fraction

Example
fraction1 = Fraction(4, 5)
print(fraction1 + Fraction(1, 8))
# outputs: 37/40

Enjoy!
