Return the secret integer in a range based on the response from the guess_bot.

You are given a low and high range (inclusive) and an instance of GuessBot (guess_bot).

You are only to interact with guess_bot by its method: guess_number(num) which returns a string.

guess_bot is a bit of an asshole and only returns the following strings when you call guess_number(number):

'Smaller': Your guess is too big
'Larger': Your guess is too small
'Correct': Your guess is correct
'You failed, you bring great shame to your family name': You ran out of tries
'What are you, deaf?': Returned if you continously call guess_number after you already guessed the correct number

You only have log2(N) calls to guess_number before the bot starts calling you a failure. N is the number of possible integers in the [low, high] range.

1 <= N <= 10^14

low <= high

Hint: use binary search
