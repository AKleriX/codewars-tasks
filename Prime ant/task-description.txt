The Prime ( https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/144695/the-prime-ant ) ant ( https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2487116/does-the-prime-ant-ever-backtrack ) (A293689 ( http://oeis.org/A293689 )) is an obstinate animal that navigates the integers and divides them until there are only primes left, according to the following procedure:

An infinite array/list A is initialized to contain all the integers greater than 1: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, …]
Let p be the position of the ant on the array/list. Initially p = 0, so the ant is at A[0] = 2
At each turn, the ant moves as follows:

If A[p] is prime, move the ant one position forward, so p ← p + 1
Otherwise (if A[p] is composite):

Let q be its smallest divisor greater than 1
Replace A[p] with A[p] / q
Replace A[p−1] with A[p−1] + q
Move the ant one position backward, so p ← p − 1

Your task is to comlete the function that computes the position of the prime ant after n turns.

Examples
primeAnt(2)   // => 2
primeAnt(11)  // => 5
primeAnt(47)  // => 9
