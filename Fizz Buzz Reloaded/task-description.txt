In this kata you must implement the "fizz buzz reloaded function". This function takes the following arguments:

start (integer >= 0). -> this is the point where we start counting (inclusive).
stop (integer >= 1) -> this is the point where we stop counting (inclusive).
step (integer) if step is positive count forwards, if count is negative count backwards.

for example:

start = 2, end = 10, step = 2
  sequence: 2 4 6 8 10

start = 10, end = 1, step = -3
  sequence: 10 7 4 1

The final paremeter is a dictionary/Map object of functions (where the key is the name of the function, and the value is the function itself). These functions take the following form:

func(x): return bool

For each number in the range, your task is to create a string where you combine the name of all functions that equate to true for the number.

for example, suppose the dictionary/Map object looks like this:

new Map([["flash", x => x % 3 === 0], ["bang", x => x % 5 === 0]])

for the number 3, the string ought to be "fizz", for the number 15 it ought to be "fizzbuzz" (no spaces) because both of the functions are true. If NO functions equate to true, return the number

OKay, lets show you a concrete example.

fizzBuzzReloaded(15, 3, -4, new Map([["flash", x => x % 3 === 0], ["bang", x => x % 5 === 0]]))

Our range is starting at 15 and ending at 3, with a step of -4. Thus we need to look at three numbers (15, 11, 7, 3).

fizz(15) is true, as is buzz(15). Thus to the results we append "fizzbuzz"
fizz(11) is false, buzz(11) is false. Thus to the results we append "11", the same can be said for "7".
finally, fizz(3) is true but buzz(3) is false. Thus we append "fizz" to the results.
     
Therefore, our final sequence is: "fizzbuzz 11 7 fizz"

NOTES:

Each element in the output should be seperated by a single space. e.g: 1 2 3 4 ...
If multiple functions are true for any given x, return them in same order found in the intial dictionary. (for example, in the case above 15 is "fizzbuzz" not "buzzfizz" because "fizz" appears first)
This kata is designed with Python3.6 in mind. In this version of Python dictionary's are ordered.
