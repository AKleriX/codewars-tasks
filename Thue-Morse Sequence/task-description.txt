Given a positive integer n, return first n dgits of Thue-Morse sequence, as a string (see examples).

Thue-Morse sequence is a binary sequence with 0 as the first element. The rest of the sequece is obtained by adding the Boolean (binary) complement of a group obtained so far.

For example:

0
01
0110
01101001
and so on...

Ex.:

thueMorse(1); //'0'
thueMorse(2); //'01'
thueMorse(5); //'01101'
thueMorse(10): //'0110100110'

You don't need to test if n is valid - it will always be a positive integer.
n will be between 1 and 10000
