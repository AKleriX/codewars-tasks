While writing some code, you ran into a problem. Your code runs very slowly, because you need to run many functions.

You do a bit of troubleshooting and notice that you are not draining your system's resources.

Write a function that, given a list of "slow" functions, will return the sum of the results without waiting for each function to complete individually.
