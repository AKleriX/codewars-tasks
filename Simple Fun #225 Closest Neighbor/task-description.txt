Task
Given a number n, find the largest integer below n and the smallest integer above n that are divisible by a, b, and c.

Input/Output
[input] integer n

A positive integer.

10 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5

[input] integer a,b,c

1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ 100

[output] an integer array

Array of two integers, the first integer is the largest number less than n and divisible by a, b and c, and the second one is the smallest number greater than n and divisible by a, b ans c.

Example
For n = 20, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4, the output should be [12, 24]
